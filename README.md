# Forward-Forward: Is it time to bid adieu to BackProp?
Goal:
* To implement and study the Forward-Forward[1] (FF) algorithm, and compare it with the traditional back-propagation (BackProp) framework
* Study the architectural differences of FF and BackProp and explore new architectures
* Analyze system performance of FF and BackProp

This work is done towards the coursework of CSCI: 566 Deep Learning and its Applications, taught by Prof. Jesse Thomason, during Spring 2023, at University of Southern California.
